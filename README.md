## Overview

Create a 3D image based off of an STL file and user defined spacing. Additional, options exist for rotating the mesh, adding a 3MF file to create a "color-intensity" on the surface of the image, and flipping the iamge and mesh along the vertical axial plane.

## Features

Converts STL file to a 3D image.

Options:
  - Add 3MF file to transfer mesh color to surface insensity on the image.
  - Allows mesh rotation before image creation.
  - Flip image/mesh before output along the vertical axis in the axial plane.
